          <p>
            Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order
            Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African
            elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas
            maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa,
            South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male African elephants are the
            largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13
            ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several
            distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or
            proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
            water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which
            can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.
            Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature.
            Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African
            elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants
            have smaller ears and convex or level backs. Elephants are
            herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
            savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near
            water.

          <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
          <p>
            You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the
            amphitheatre.
