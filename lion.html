          <h3>LIONS</h3>
          <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus
            Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term
            African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in
            Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is
            the second-largest living cat after the tiger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where
            an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park
            in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North
            Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late
            Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most
            widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most
            of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the
            Americas from the Yukon to Peru.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population
            decline in its African range of 30 to 50% per two decades during the
            second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable
            outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause
            of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts
            with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within
            Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.
          </p>
