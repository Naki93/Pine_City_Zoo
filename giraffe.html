          <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
          <p>
            Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that
            inhabit the forests of central Africa. The eponymous genus Gorilla
            is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western
            gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest
            living primates by physical size. The DNA of gorillas is highly
            similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is
            counted, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans
            after the chimpanzees and bonobos.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in
            Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa,
            gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla
            inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga
            Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to
            14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland
            swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland
            gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern
            lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near
            its border with Rwanda.
